# Send Test Orders

- Open the OrderProducer in swagger: [https://robot-orderproducer-dev.azurewebsites.net/swagger](https://robot-orderproducer-dev.azurewebsites.net/swagger)
- To create orders, there are two approaches available: ```Orders``` and ```OrderProducer```
  - ```Orders``` allows you to send an order with a given message
  - ```OrderProducer``` creates a stream of orders. The two ```post``` Restful APIs *start* and *stop* the stream. To start the stream, 
    - *maxItems* is the number of orders you want to post, **-1** makes the stream running infinitely
    - *batchSize* is the number of orders you want to post each time, e.g., *maxItems* is 10, *batchSize* is 2, then stream will post 5 iterations of orders with 2 orders each
    - *delayInSecs* is the interval time between posts
